                specified destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter 
                is set to the number of received characters.

                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.

                the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that are not 
                generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this case the

                initialized.      Note: This initialization mode doesn't preserve time and date settings.   2) RTC device IS 
                battery backed up.     (SoftInit = TRUE). Only registers that are not backed up are initialized (Interrupt 
                priority ). RTC device is running, time and date a preserved, RTC interrupts (events) are preserved too.   
                Allocates memory for the device data structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call 
                of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.

                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
   - Cpu_SetOperationMode -This method requests to change the component's operation mode (RUN, WAIT, SLEEP, STOP). The target 
                operation mode will be entered immediately.   See <Operation mode settings> for further details of the 
                operation modes mapping to low power modes of the cpu.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_VLPModeEnable -This method enables Very Low Power (VLP) mode in the active clock configuration. To enable the VLP mode 
                the active clock configuration has to have the <Very low power mode> property enabled. The method waits until 
                the entry to the VLP mode is confirmed by a power management module status register.  This method can be 
                enabled only when one of the clock configurations modes have the <Very low power mode> property enabled.
   - Cpu_VLPModeDisable -This method disables the Very Low Power (VLP) mode in the active clock configuration. The method waits 
                until the exit of the VLP mode is confirmed by a power management module status register.  This method can be 
                enabled only when one of the clock configurations have the <Very low power mode> property enabled.
